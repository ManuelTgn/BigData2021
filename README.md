# BigData2021
Final Project of PhD course on Big Data Analysis - University of Verona (ay 2020-21)

### Overview 

Project description and guidelines are stored in ```project_description.pdf```. This PDF file describes two potential projects to assess the understanding of contents presented during PhD course on Big Data analysis. 

The project proposes the analysis of one of two publicly available datasets by performing some easy and complex queries with Python package ```pyspark```. To pass the assessment, the student should choose one of the two datasets and write a notebook with:

- Some exploratory analysis
- The answers to queries proposed for that dataset

The proposed datasets are:

- [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/dataset/documentation/main) dataset
- [Movielens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) dataset

In this project will be analyzed the **Movielens** dataset (available in ```data``` directory).

The IPython notebook with exploratory analysis and answers to queries can be found in ```src``` directory.

### Required packages

To run the notebook are required the following Python packages:
- ```pyspark```
- ```datetime```
- ```sklearn```
- ```matplotlib```
- ```seaborn```
- ```pandas```
- ```numpy```
- ```scipy```

They can all be downloaded and installed through ```pip install -- packagename --```.
